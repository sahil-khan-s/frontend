    "1. Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Can you provide examples of each and explain when you would use each approach?",
    "2. How do you handle imbalanced datasets in machine learning? Can you provide some techniques or algorithms that can be used to address this issue?",
    "3. Can you discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning? How do you determine the optimal balance between bias and variance in a model?",
    "4. How do you handle missing data in a dataset? Can you discuss some common techniques for imputing missing values and explain when each technique would be appropriate?",
    "5. Can you explain the process of feature selection in machine learning? How do you determine which features are most important for a given problem and what techniques or algorithms do you use to select those features?"
